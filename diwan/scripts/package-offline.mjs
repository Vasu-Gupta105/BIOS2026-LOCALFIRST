Extract the FULL ZIP on BOTH Windows laptops, then double-click Start-LocalFirst-Offline.cmd. No Node.js, Go installation, cloud login, or internet connection is needed. Keep the web directory beside localfirst-offline.exe. Running the launcher directly inside the ZIP will not work.

Documents are stored in the current browser profile's IndexedDB for http://127.0.0.1:8765. Use the same browser/profile and port. Use Export workspace for a backup before clearing browser data. Do not use a private/incognito window for important documents.

Offline help explains saving and recovery. Restore backup adds new copies and keeps existing files. Restore currently accepts LocalFirst JSON backups up to 32 MiB. See docs/OFFLINE-USER-SAFETY-AUDIT.md for verified scenarios and remaining limits.

Pair the laptops in Windows Bluetooth Settings and verify matching Windows pairing numbers on both. Run this same updated package on both laptops. On the owner laptop, open a document, choose Bluetooth, then Share this document. Give the other laptop the FOUR-DIGIT pairing code (keep any leading zeros), and leave the dialog open. On the second laptop choose Bluetooth sharing, select the paired hosting laptop, enter the four digits, then Connect over Bluetooth. On the owner laptop, verify the requesting laptop's Bluetooth address and choose Allow this laptop within 30 seconds. The other laptop can then Open shared file. See docs/WINDOWS-BLUETOOTH.md for the full procedure.

The short code expires after two minutes, locks after three failed attempts, and can be approved once. Choose Share this document again for a fresh code. It works only over direct, authenticated and encrypted Windows Bluetooth with host approval; the code is not a traffic encryption key. Experimental relays require the full invitation. The established document channel still uses the full certificate pin and random secret with TLS 1.3.

Full invitation fallback: expand Invitation file and full code on the owner laptop and choose Save invitation file, then look in Downloads for localfirst-bluetooth-invitation.json (Ctrl+J opens browser downloads). Transfer THAT file to the other laptop and choose Load invitation file. Export workspace produces a document backup. The importer explains wrong files and will not connect with an incomplete or previously rejected full invitation.

From Home, choose Bluetooth sharing, select File to share, then Open file to share. The document opens with its Bluetooth dialog. Choose Share this document to generate a four-digit code and enable the full invitation fallback. Choose a file from this device can import supported document, spreadsheet, presentation, PDF and Excalidraw formats.

Inter-laptop transport uses real Windows classic Bluetooth RFCOMM with authenticated/encrypted pairing and a pinned TLS 1.3 invitation. The browser contacts only its own local helper; no Wi-Fi, LAN relay, tunnel or internet server carries document edits. Both copies retain a local Yjs update journal and exchange missing edits after reconnection. A peer acknowledgement follows the receiving journal commit.

This is a Windows-only preview. Radio listening/registration and protocol/editor recovery are tested separately; a full physical two-laptop transfer must still be verified on your devices. Android is not supported yet. This is not a production-certified release. Supports Docs, Sheets, Slides, whiteboards and PDFs. Limits: one file and one peer, Docs source snapshots up to 512 KiB, shared replica data up to 1 MiB including images and PDF bytes, invitation lifetime 30 minutes. Keep workspace backups.

The launcher starts a hidden local helper for bundled assets and Bluetooth. Keep it running for Bluetooth collaboration. Once installation completes, the PWA can reopen from its asset cache for local editing. The launcher serves bundled assets without internet even on first launch.

The launcher opens /api/offline-launch to activate the current app even when an older offline version is cached. It keeps the browser origin, saved documents and existing editor tabs. Save your work before updating; existing editor tabs can be reopened after their work is saved.
