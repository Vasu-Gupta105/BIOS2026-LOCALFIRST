## What is LocalFirst?

LocalFirst is a **standalone, self-hostable office suite** — documents, spreadsheets,
slides, and whiteboards in one clean, modern web app, shipped as a **single Go
binary** with the entire frontend embedded. There is no cloud account to create,
nothing phones home, and your files live in **your own storage**.

Real-time co-editing is **peer-to-peer and CRDT-native**: there is no central
document server. Peers sync directly over an end-to-end-encrypted channel, and
because edits are conflict-free (CRDTs), everyone converges with no authority in
the middle. What you run is what you own.

It carries the torch lit by **LibreOffice** and **OpenOffice** — the projects
that proved productivity software can be free, open, and community-driven — into
the browser, on a fast React frontend and a lightweight Go backend.

## Features

| | |
|---|---|
| 📝 **Documents** | Rich-text editing (TipTap) — headings, tables, inline images, footnotes, task lists, links; anchored **comments**, **suggestions** (track-changes with accept/reject), **version history** with restore, find/replace, live outline + word count. |
| 📊 **Spreadsheets** | A full grid (Fortune Sheet) — formulas, number formats, conditional formatting, **data validation**, **charts**, **filters**, **pivot tables**, **named ranges**, freeze panes. |
| 🖼️ **Slides** | A from-scratch positioned-object canvas — free drag/resize/rotate of text, shapes, and images; per-element **animations**, **themes**, editable **master slides**, per-slide **transitions**, and a **presenter view** (notes + timer). |
| 🎨 **Whiteboards** | An infinite hand-drawn canvas built on the MIT [Excalidraw](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw) editor — shapes, arrows, freehand, text, and images. The scene is a **Yjs CRDT** synced over the **same** E2E-encrypted P2P engine as Docs. |
| ⚡ **Real-time co-editing** | **Always peer-to-peer, no central document server.** Edits sync as CRDT updates inside an **end-to-end-encrypted** room; peers connect directly over WebRTC with a **content-blind relay** only as a hard-NAT fallback. Share by invite link — the key rides the URL fragment and never reaches any server. |
| 📄 **PDF import / export & signing** | Import and export `.docx` · `.xlsx` · `.csv` · `.pptx` · Markdown · HTML · **PDF**. View, annotate, fill AcroForm fields, and **sign** PDFs, including multi-party signing envelopes with a cryptographic audit trail. |
| 💾 **Your own storage** | Local files + SQLite by default; optional **PostgreSQL** (schema `office`) for multi-user; optional **S3-compatible** object store. Nothing is hosted for you unless you choose it. |
| 🔓 **No lock-in** | Open formats in and out, MIT-licensed, single self-contained binary. Every editor is also published as an npm library (the `localfirst` package — `localfirst/docs`, `localfirst/sheets`, `localfirst/slides`, `localfirst/whiteboard`, `localfirst/pdf`) so you can embed any surface in your own app. |

LocalFirst is **documents-only** by design: Docs, Sheets, Slides, Whiteboards, and
PDF signing. Chat, video, and mail are deliberately *not* part of it.

## Screenshots

The current LocalFirst interface uses an indigo accent, a clear workspace sidebar
and dedicated editors for each file type, with light, dark and system themes.
These screenshots show the real offline app with sample files, captured on
1 November 2026.

## Quick start

LocalFirst runs **by itself** — no account, no cloud, no external service required.

### Docker (build and run)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vasu-Gupta105/BIOS2026.git localfirst
cd localfirst
docker build -t localfirst:local .
docker run -d \
  --name localfirst \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v localfirst-data:/srv/data \
  -v localfirst-uploads:/srv/uploads \
  localfirst:local
```

Open <http://localhost:8080>. For an existing installation, reuse its current data and uploads volumes.

### From source (single binary)

Prerequisites: [Go 1.25+](https://golang.org/dl/) and [Node.js 22.12+ or 20.19+](https://nodejs.org/) with npm. The module may download its pinned Go toolchain.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vasu-Gupta105/BIOS2026.git localfirst
cd localfirst

# Install deps and build the frontend + single binary
npm --prefix web ci
npm --prefix web run build

# Run — single-user, local storage, no auth, no cloud
./localfirst
```

Open <http://localhost:8080>. Data lives in `./data` and `./uploads` — that's the
whole app, in one file. The Go module and the binary it builds are named
`localfirst`; the npm package and the product are **LocalFirst**.

To require login (still fully standalone):

```bash
# config.yaml → auth.enabled: true
export LOCALFIRST_JWT_SECRET="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
./localfirst
```

### Develop

```bash
npm run dev:web   # Vite dev server (:5173) + Go API (:8080), live reload
```

Open <http://localhost:5173>.

### Install from the Vulos app store

LocalFirst also installs as a one-click app on a **Vulos OS** box (`DEPLOY_MODE=os`),
where it runs behind the box gateway with scoped storage and single sign-on. It
is the **same binary** — the app store just wires identity and storage for you.
Self-hosting it yourself is always the default path, and never second-class.

```

LocalFirst is a **single Go binary with the whole frontend embedded** — one file to
deploy. With zero configuration it runs as a single-user, local-storage app on
your own machine. Everything that *could* tie it to an external service lives
behind a small set of Go interfaces in `backend/seam`; the standalone build
wires local, unlimited, no-op defaults and never imports the optional adapter.

Real-time collaboration is **CRDT-based and always peer-to-peer**: Docs and
whiteboards sync as Yjs updates, Sheets and Slides use LWW/tree CRDTs, all inside
an end-to-end-encrypted room whose key never reaches any server. The only server
role is **content-blind peer discovery** — it learns *that* peers share a random
room id, never any content — and **this binary serves that itself**, at
`/api/rendezvous/*`, on by default. So one `localfirst` on one box is all two people
need: **no Vulos OS, no Pier, no relay, no account, nothing to configure**. You
*may* delegate discovery to your own `vulos-relayd` instead
(`collab.rendezvous_url` / `VULOS_RENDEZVOUS_URL`), and it then takes precedence —
the browser talks to that relay directly and LocalFirst's server is not in the
discovery path at all. See
[docs/COLLABORATION.md](docs/COLLABORATION.md) §3 and
[docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

> **Frozen invariants:** pure Go (no CGO), JSX only (never `.tsx`), no third-party
> SSO or payment lock-in in the standalone build. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Security

LocalFirst centralises HTML sanitisation in one audited DOMPurify policy, treats CRDT
ingress as fail-closed, gates read-only collaborators cryptographically, and
enforces per-file ACLs when multi-user auth is on. Found a vulnerability? Please
report it **privately** — see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md), [THREAT-MODEL.md](docs/THREAT-MODEL.md),
and [SECURITY-TESTING.md](docs/SECURITY-TESTING.md). Do not open public issues for
security reports.

---

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome — bug fixes, signing robustness, accessibility, tests,
and docs especially. For major changes, open an issue first. See
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for setup, code style, and the frozen
invariants. No CLA required.

---

## Brand

The mark in [`brand/`](brand/) is the source of truth. Every icon this repo
ships — favicon, PWA and app icons, the mark in the README and on the site — is
rendered from `brand/logo.svg` rather than redrawn, so there is one approved
drawing and no second copy to drift.

Copy it outward, never edit a derived copy, and never edit `brand/` to match
something downstream.
